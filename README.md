# SPARKLE
Sparkle is a blogging web app that allows its users to write, read, discover and share blog posts to other users. A user can follow as many users as he wants. Whenever a user posts or another user comments on a post, all parties involved are notified via Short Message Service (SMS) using Africastalking’s SMS API. Sparkle allows users to blog about anything that comes into the mind of bloggers which for example is to blog about relationships, the environment, photography just to mention a few. Later version of Sparkle will make users know the number of views their blog posts receives. Also, there will be a ‘Like’ button to like any post a reader loved.
